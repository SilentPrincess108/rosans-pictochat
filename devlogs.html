                        and at the time of writing this, am 30 mins away from completion! However I feel really happy and excited to create a personalized space for my interests and passions to share with others!
                        there are some parts of thsi site that are rll crappy since I'm rushing a couple things. But once I reach the hr goal, I hope to take my time working on this to perfect it to my vision!
                        Watching a bunch of Last Meals episodes to help me get through this lmao!</p>
